# BLÅHAJ

## Selenium Web Scraping in R
An RStudio notebook to scrape reviews for IKEA products.  Tested on the cult classic BLÅHAJ Soft toy, shark, 39¼".

## Why?
I wanted to teach myself the basics of Web scraping using Selenium.  It would have been easier to keep all of this in a python Jupyter notebook.  At the time, however, my python was very weak, and I was getting comfortable exploring datasets in R.  Instead, I took the chance to learn [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) and did what I knew how to do in each language.  

## Shiny app
Because why not? A little app to print random reviews, hosted [here](http://ag5tc.shinyapps.io/shiny_blahaj/).  

## 2023 update:
My python is a lot better now, so I went back over and cleaned up the code.  Ran into the delightful challenge of having both `x86_64` and `arm64` conda environments on one (Apple M1) machine.
