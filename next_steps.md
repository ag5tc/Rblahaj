# Next Steps

* keyword search functionality in the Shiny app
* sort functionality (date, stars, etc.)

* output to png / clipboard: send a Bl√•haj to a friend
* make print / ecard layout

* make a tab with all of the reviews on it, in addition to the random one
* maybe a page with fun maps or graphs?

```
# also scrape the ratings and reviews "categories"?
# i.e. Value for money, Product quality, Appearance, Works as expected
# (each is a value 1-5
```
